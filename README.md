### Cura Profile
The PLA profile is still a work in progress.  

#### Cura 3.2.1 
Added profile exported out of Cura 3.2.1. Also is now updated with acceleration and jerk settings to match the Marlin 1.1.8c firmware. Cura should now give you a more accurate print time +/-10%. So far in testing its been pretty close.
